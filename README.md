# KNN---Handwritten-Digit-Classification
This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset**.   Steps include loading the dataset, visualizing samples, preprocessing with scaling, training KNN with different K values, and evaluating performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and sample predictions.
